title: "Robotic Path Planning of a PUMA Robot for Beating Heart Surgery"
excerpt: "MATLAB programming coursework for robotics course"

This [repository](https://github.com/changh95/MATLAB-Robot-Path-Planning) includes MATLAB codes for robotic path planning of a PUMA robot using [Robotics Toolbox by Peter Corke](http://petercorke.com/wordpress/toolboxes/robotics-toolbox). The purpose of this code was purely for academic coursework, and may not represent the complexity of real-world situations. The coursework context assumes that the programmer is performing path planning for PUMA robot to perform beating heart surgery.

However, I have also attempted to extend this project into real-world applications by generating the intial trajectory data based on computer vision. First, I have tracked visual features of the beating heart at its maximum systole and diastole to obtain the range of dynamic geometry. Then, I assumed constant rate of heart beating and calculated the rate of dynamic change of the shape. This then allowed me to generate a robot trajectory moving in one direction. The downside of this approach is that topological consideration is absent, therefore it is not possible to obtain the normal to surface information. This part of the code can easily be implemented, so is not included in the repository.

**Used software:**
* MATLAB 2016b
* Robotics Toolbox v10
* Images captured using MATLAB 2018b.

**Pre-Requisites**
trajectory_data.mat is provided prior to any programming.

-----------------

Task 1
====
Build a PUMA robot and move the end-effector to follow a linear trajectory along a sphere (topological representation of heart).

Task 2
====
Ensure that the end-effector is always perpendicular to the sphere surface.

Task 3
====
Repeat steps 1 and 2 keeping a constant velocity of the end-effector of 0.1m/s for a time-varying trajectory due to the sphere changing its size (is beating!)
