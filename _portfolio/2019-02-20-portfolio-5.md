SLAM KR is a Facebook group where the members share research information on Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping.
This group consists of researchers, enthusiasts and hobbyists from all over the world (though the majority of members speak Korean language), and we work on many aspects to lower the entry boundary to this technology, as well as encouraging each other to make outstanding work. __[Link](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slamkr/)__

As a member I have contributed in translating the book on Visual-SLAM by Gao Xiang __([Book Link](https://item.jd.com/12077296218.html))__, along with 4 other members. The book is originally writen in Mandarin Chinese, which I do not speak of, but the members and I have used online translations (e.g. Google Translate + Papago Translate + WeChat Translate) to make a Korean-translated version.

The Korean translated book content is now going on public __([Github Link](
https://github.com/slam-research-group-kr/slambook-ko))__, which the complementary codes are linked to the original github repository so that practice is available.

Currently there is a study group based on this book's contents __[Youtube Channel Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i8PaekcguA&list=PLubUquiqNQdOTNocmWCSWk9ZaWhV7ubCD)__, which I am taking part of. On weekly basis, we go on a roll to present the content of the book, whilst feeding in more information and practicality as much as we can. I have also presented twice, of which the topics were on **['Image expression'](https://github.com/changh95/changh95.github.io/blob/master/files/%EC%9E%A5%ED%98%95%EA%B8%B0_%EC%9D%B4%EB%AF%B8%EC%A7%80%20%ED%91%9C%ED%98%84.pptx?raw=true)** and **'[Non-linear optimisation : State-estimation of robots](https://github.com/changh95/changh95.github.io/blob/master/files/%EC%9E%A5%ED%98%95%EA%B8%B0_%EB%B9%84%EC%84%A0%ED%98%95%20%EC%B5%9C%EC%A0%81%ED%99%94.pptx?raw=true)'**.
