During cancer surgeries, surgeons cannot differentiate between cancerous tissues and healthy tissues without the aid of histology lab. The process of this analysis, which consists of taking a physical biopsy, taking it to the lab, performing analysis, and returning the report back to the operating theatre, is identified as a very inefficient process and also is the main cause of long cancer surgeries. Also, the current gold standard of histopathological analysis suffers from its destructive nature, artifacts, sampling errors and interpretation errors. To tackle this problem, a spectroscopic optical biopsy method, called Diffuse Reflectance Spectroscopy, is proposed along with a vision-based tracking system. An ergonomic non-destructive real-time tissue classification and visualisation system, and the appropriate clinical procedure plan is expected as the research outcome.
