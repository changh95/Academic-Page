Projects
====

**Individual:**

* **“Mobile Rover for Environment Mapping and Human Detection”**
  * Built a voice-controlled rover on Jetson TX2, using RTAB-map (SLAM) and tiny-YOLO.
  * Award winning project at Embedded AI Hackathon.
* **“Dynamic Feature Segmentation during Structure from Motion”**
  * Segmentation of dynamic objects in the scene using epipolar constraints.
* **“Snapchat-like Face Filters using OpenCV and Dlib”**
  * Built Spot-removal filter, AR Kawaii-filter, Emotion masks, and Panda-face filter.
* **“Make Surgical Scenes Less Disturbing”**
  * Reduced visual disturbance in surgical images via Neural-Style Algorithm and frame buffer.
* **“Image Classification of Flower Species”**
  * Built an image-classifier for plants based on their petal shapes.
* **“Depth Mapping and Visualisation using Multiple Webcams and OpenCV”**
  * Built a depth estimation system more affordable compared to commercial depth cameras.
* **“Surgical Cobot Control using Gaze Control and QR Code Commands”**
  * A concept code to use cobots in surgical theatre to pick up and pass tools to surgeons.
* **“Computer Vision Programming Practice”**
  * Implementation of Structure from Motion (SfM), Lidar SLAM, 3D map reconstruction, Visual odometry etc

------------

**MRes:**

* **"A Real-Time Intraoperative Data Mapping Device for Probe-Based Measurement Using Computer Vision"**
  * Real-time tracking of intraoperative optical biopsy position using vision-based tracking.
* **"Intraoperative Tissue Classification using Hyperspectral Sensing"**
  * Classification of diffuse reflectance spectra of gastrointestinal cancers and healthy tissues, using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* **"Mechanical Optimisation of Endosopic Robot (CYCLOPS) for Bi-manual Suturing"**
  * A group project on mechanical optimsation of the cable-driven parallel mechanism (CDPM) in the CYCLOPS robot, for an effective transfer of suturing hand movements to the robo. Infrared tracking and workspace optimisation using Pattern Search Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSwarm) were used. I was in charge of hardware development, which included infrared tracking rig and actuator system.
* **"Vision-Based Endoscopic Navigation Using SLAM"**
  * Monocular vSLAM on a rigid colon phantom.
* **"Robotic Path Planning for Beating Heart Surgery"**
  * Inverse Kinematics of PUMA robot for a trajectory on a repeating regular deformation.
* **Essay - "Natural Orifice Transluminal Surgery (NOTES), where does it stand?"**
  * Described the principles of NOTES in the context of available technology and outlined key challenges and potential solutions that need to be addressed before widespread adoption
* **Essay - "Literature Review of Medical Robot Technologies"**
  * Described the advances in surgical robotic platforms that have recently reached the marketplace or have been described in the literature, and evaluated the functionality, novelty and cost-effectiveness compared with established systems.

------------

**BEng:**

* **"Development of modular training phantom for MRI radiologists"**
  * Development of an MRI phantom for deliberate artefact generation for education purpose, using industrial product development techniques.
* **"Analysis of Industry 4.0 Based Manufacturing System Architecture on Quality Perspective"**
  * Literature review of technological advances related to Industry 4.0.
* **“Text Writing Robots”**
  * Programmed an ABB robot to convert a text input into physical writing.
