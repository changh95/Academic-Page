Projects
====

**Individual:**

* **"Image Style Transfer"**
  * Implementation of Gatys et al.’s Neural-Style Algorithm using PyTorch
* **“Image Classification of Flower Species”**
  * Built an image-classifier for 109 different species of plant based on their petal shapes.
* **“Survivor Search and Environment Mapping Rover for Disaster Situations”**
  * Built a mobile rover using Jetson TX2, using SLAM, YOLO and Android control.
* **“Surgical Cobot Control using QR Code Commands”**
  * A concept code to use cobots in surgical theatre to pick up and pass tools to surgeons.

**MRes:**

* **"A Real-Time Intraoperative Data Mapping Device for Probe-Based Measurement Using Computer Vision"**
  * Real-time tracking of intraoperative optical biopsy position using vision-based tracking.
* **"Intraoperative Tissue Classification using Hyperspectral Sensing"**
  * Classification of diffuse reflectance spectra of gastrointestinal cancers and healthy tissues, using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* **"Mechanical Optimisation of Endosopic Robot (CYCLOPS) for Bi-manual Suturing"**
  * A group project on mechanical optimsation of the cable-driven parallel mechanism (CDPM) in the CYCLOPS robot, for an effective transfer of suturing hand movements to the robo. Infrared tracking and workspace optimisation using Pattern Search Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSwarm) were used. I was in charge of hardware development, which included infrared tracking rig and actuator system.
* **"Vision-Based Endoscopic Navigation Using SLAM"**
  * Monocular vSLAM on a rigid colon phantom.
* **"Robotic Path Planning for Beating Heart Surgery"**
  * Inverse Kinematics of PUMA robot for a trajectory on a repeating regular deformation.
* **Essay - "Natural Orifice Transluminal Surgery (NOTES), where does it stand?"**
  * Described the principles of NOTES in the context of available technology and outlined key challenges and potential solutions that need to be addressed before widespread adoption
* **Essay - "Literature Review of Medical Robot Technologies"**
  * Described the advances in surgical robotic platforms that have recently reached the marketplace or have been described in the literature, and evaluated the functionality, novelty and cost-effectiveness compared with established systems.

------------

**BEng:**

* **"Development of modular training phantom for MRI radiologists"**
  * Development of an MRI phantom for deliberate artefact generation for education purpose, using industrial product development techniques.
* **"Analysis of Industry 4.0 Based Manufacturing System Architecture on Quality Perspective"**
  * Literature review of technological advances related to Industry 4.0.
